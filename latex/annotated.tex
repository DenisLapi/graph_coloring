\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnode__struct}{node\+\_\+struct} \\*This is the structure of nodes that we are creating for Welsh-\/\+Powell algorithms. We are using this structure to compare the properties between nodes such as id, sum\+\_\+connection, colors. When we are resolving the graph coloring problem with Welsh-\/\+Powell algorithm, we are coloring nodes starting from the nodes with a bigger number of connections }{\pageref{structnode__struct}}{}
